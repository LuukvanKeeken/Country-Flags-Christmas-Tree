I created an animation that displays flags of European countries on the tree, in alphabetical order. Each display was created by essentially overlaying a flag on the Y-Z plane, and setting each light's colours to the colour of the closest flag image pixel. Therefore, the animation is best viewed perpendicular to the Y-Z plane. As the tree is not rectangular, the top-left and top-right sections of the flags are not displayed on the tree. Unsurprisingly, flags with detailed imagery don't come into their own due to the low resolution, but most the more "simple" flags are quite easy to recognise.
I started out creating an animation for all of the world's flags, but the CSV file became too large for GitHub.
